[Brian][1] and [Jon][2] traveled to National Harbor, MD (just outside Washington DC) to attend the 232nd Meeting of the Electrochemical Society, their first conference in graduate school.
[Jon][2] gave a [talk][3] on predicted non-linear electrochemical impedance spectra (NLEIS) of CO_2 electrolysis on gadolinia-doped ceria, and [Brian][1] [presented][4] on using strain-based scanning probe techniques to detect space charge regions in samarium-doped ceria.
