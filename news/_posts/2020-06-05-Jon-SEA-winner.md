Last week our department announced winners of the annual ["Science & Engineering as Art Competition"]. The competition was established to highlight the beauty we encounter everyday in our research.
Two SSEEL members, ([Jon][1] and [Brian][2]), submitted entries for the competition highlighting core technologies used in their respective projects. Against a field of eight total entries, [Jon][1] emerged victorious, securing 1st place with his entry "Light at the End of the Tunnel". Congratulations Jon!
