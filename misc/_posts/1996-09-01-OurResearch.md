At the Solid State Electrochemistry and Energy Lab (SSEEL), we study from the fundamental science to the application of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).
We develop transient and operando electrochemical diagnostics, in conjunction with detailed physical models, to study electrochemistry system and
apply these techniques to enhance our understanding of SOFC materials' performance and mechanisms. Our lab's mission to further energy sustainability
through the deployment of SOFC and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) as the pathway for chemical energy storage.
