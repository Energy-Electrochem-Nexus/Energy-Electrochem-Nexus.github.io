Stu Adler and his research group seek to better understand the electrocatalytic properties of solids, and how these properties relate to electrochemical processes
 and devices.  The broad motivation for his work is energy sustainability - electrocatalysts enable key technologies for energy conversion and storage, including
 fuel cells, solid-state electrolysis and photochemical devices, batteries, and gas separation membranes.  His group employs cutting-edge transient and _operando_
 electrochemical diagnostics, in conjunction with detailed physical models, to better understand local properties and dynamics of electrocatalysts.

Dr. Adler received his PhD in Chemical Engineering in 1993 from the University of California, Berkeley. After a postdoc in the Department of Materials at
 Imperial College, he served as a staff scientist at Ceramatec, Inc. before rejoining academia in 1999.  Professor Adlerâ€™s awards include a NSF-NATO
 postdoctoral Fellowship (1993), NSF Career Award (2001), Charles W. Tobias Young Investigator Award of the Electrochemical Society (2004), and UW Junior
 Faculty Innovator Award (2007).
