Jon Witt joined UW in September 2015 after graduating with his Bachelors in Chemical Engineering from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.
 He currently researches electrolysis of carbon dioxide and water on solid oxides, with the goal of aiding the development of alternative fuels made from renewable
 energy. In his career and volunteer time, he aspires to achieve a renewable energy based economy with a climate justice focused lens. When he's not doing the science,
 he likes to host and participate in events that encourage community engagement in policy making, from the local to the Federal level. He also likes camping, hiking,
 and biking. Might as well add Patagonia in there too.
