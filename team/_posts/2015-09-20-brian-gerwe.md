Brian earned his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the [University of Arizona] in 2015. While there he researched the impacts of refrigerant choise on greenhouse gas emissions in 
mobile air conditioning units through life cycle analysis estimates. He joined the [Department of Chemical Engineering] at University of Washington in the Fall of 2015 under advisement of 
of [Stuart Adler] to develop methods for studying local phenomena (nm to um scale) at electrochemical interfaces in _operando_ conditions using scanning probe microscopies. Brian is a former
President of the [Association of Chemical Engineering Graduate Students], and Vice President of Education for the [UW chapter of the Electrochemical Society].

In his spare time, Brian enjoys running around Greenlake, skateboarding around Seattle, and occasionally playing drums in post-punk bands.
