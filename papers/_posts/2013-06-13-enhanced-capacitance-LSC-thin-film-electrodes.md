# Abstract 

Films of La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub> (LSC-82)
 with 45 and 90 nm thickness were grown epitaxially on (001)
 oriented single crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia with a thin gadolinium-doped ceria interlayer using pulsed laser deposition,
 and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), depth-profile secondary mass spectrometry (DP-SIMS), and linear and nonlinear electrochemical
 impedance spectroscopy (EIS and NLEIS). The films were found to exhibit in-plane tensile strain and normal compressive strain (with overall increased
 lattice volume) relative to freestanding cubic LSC-82. The films also possess a compositional La/Sr gradient across their thickness, with enhanced Sr<sup>2+</sup>
 composition (within the perovskite lattice) at the gas-exposed surface. The oxygen storage capacity of the films at 450–600°C
 (as measured using EIS capacitance) is greatly enhanced relative to freestanding cubic LSC-82, consistent with an apparent increase in oxygen-vacancy
 concentration at the gas-exposed surface of the films (as revealed by NLEIS). These results can be explained by a two-layer model in which a finite thickness
 of the perovskite lattice near the surface has an enhanced Sr dopant concentration, leading to a much higher concentration of oxygen vacancies than the
 underlying bulk material of nominal Sr composition. The nonlinear electrochemical response of the film is consistent with a dissociative adsorption rate law,
 provided the enhanced bulk vacancy concentration near the surface is included in the analysis.
