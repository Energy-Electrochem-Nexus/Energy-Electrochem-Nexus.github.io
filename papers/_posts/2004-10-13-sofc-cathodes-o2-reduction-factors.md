# Abstract 

This review focuses on the factors governing SOFC cathode performanceadvances we have made over the last 20 years in our
 scientific understanding of oxygen reduction mechanisms, how these mechanisms vary for different materials and conditions,
 and remaining questions and challenges that have been generated by this large volume of work.
