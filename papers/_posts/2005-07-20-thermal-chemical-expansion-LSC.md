# Abstract 

The equilibrium thermal expansivity (β<sub>T</sub>) and oxygen-vacancy chemical expansivity (β<sub>C</sub>)
 of polycrystalline La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub> (LSC; x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7) have been measured at
 600 °C < T < 900 °C and 10<sup>-4</sup> atm < P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> < 0.21 atm using controlled-atmosphere dilatometry.
 These measurements show only a moderate dependence of β<sub>T</sub> on temperature, suggesting that increases
 often observed in the coefficient of thermal expansion when measured at constant P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> are primarily thermally
 induced chemical expansion associated with changes in oxygen stoichiometry. The dependences of β<sub>T</sub> and β<sub>C</sub>
 on the temperature, oxygen-vacancy concentration, and Sr content (x) were characterized and found to follow
 a consistent nonlinear trend, which may result from the relaxation of lattice strain with increasing defect
 concentration. A slowly relaxing secondary expansion effect (and/or expansion hysteresis) was also discovered.
 Possible causes of this behavior, including phase transition/segregation at high vacancy concentration, are discussed.
