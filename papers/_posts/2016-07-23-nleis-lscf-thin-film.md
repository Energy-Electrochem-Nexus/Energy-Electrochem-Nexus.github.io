# Abstract 

Linear and nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, NLEIS) were used to study 20 nm thin film La<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>0.6</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>3-&delta;</sub>
 (LSCF-6428) electrodes at
600Â°C in oxygen environments. LSCF films were epitaxially deposited on single crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with a 5 nm gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC)
protective interlayer. Impedance measurements reveal an oxygen storage capacity similar to independent thermogravimetry measurements on semi-porous pellets.
However, the impedance data fail to obey a homogeneous semiconductor point-defect model. Two consistent scenarios were considered: a homogeneous film with non-ideal
thermodynamics (constrained by thermogravimetry measurements), or an inhomogeneous film (constrained by a semiconductor point-defect model with a Sr
maldistribution). The latter interpretation suggests that gradients in Sr composition would have to extend beyond the space-charge region of the gas-electrode interface.
While there is growing evidence supporting an equilibrium Sr segregation at the LSCF surface monolayer, a long-range, non-equilibrium Sr stratification caused by electrode
processing conditions offers a possible explanation for the large volume of highly reducible LSCF. Additionally, all thin films exhibited fluctuations in both linear and
nonlinear impedance over the hundred-hour measurement period. This behavior is inconsistent with changes solely in the surface rate coefficient and possibly caused by
variations in the surface thermodynamics over exposure time.
