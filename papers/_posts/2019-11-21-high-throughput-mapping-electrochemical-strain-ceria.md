# Abstract 

Dynamic strain based atomic force microscopy (AFM) modes often fail at the interfaces where the most interesting physics occurs because of their
 incapability of tracking contact resonance accurately under rough topography. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a high-throughput sequential
 excitation AFM that captures contact dynamics of probeâ€“sample interactions with high fidelity and efficiency, acquiring the spectrum of data on
 each pixel over a range of frequencies that are excited in a sequential manner. Using electrochemically active granular ceria as an example, we
 map both linear and quadratic electrochemical strain accurately across grain boundaries with high spatial resolution where the conventional approach
 fails. The enhanced electrochemical responses point to the accumulation of small polarons in the space charge region at the grain boundaries, thought
 to be responsible for the enhanced electronic conductivity in nanocrystalline ceria. The spectrum of data can be processed very efficiently by
 physics-informed principal component analysis (PCA), speeding data processing by several orders of magnitude. This approach can be applied to a variety
 of AFM modes for studying a wide range of materials and structures on the nanoscale.
