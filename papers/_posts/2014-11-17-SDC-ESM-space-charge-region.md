# Abstract 

Nanocrystalline ceria exhibits a total conductivity several orders of magnitude higher than
 microcrystalline ceria in air at high temperature. The most widely accepted theory for this
 enhancement (based on fitting of conductivity data to various transport and kinetic models) is that
 relatively immobile positively charged defects and/or impurities accumulate at the grain boundary
 core, leading to a counterbalancing increase in the number of mobile electrons (small polarons)
 within a diffuse space charge region adjacent to each grain boundary. In an effort to validate this
 model, we have applied electrochemical strain microscopy to image the location and relative
 population of mobile electrons near grain boundaries in polycrystalline Sm-doped ceria in air at
 20â€“200 C. Our results show the first direct (spatially resolved) evidence that such a diffuse space
 charge region does exist in ceria, and is localized to both grain boundaries and the gas-exposed surface.
