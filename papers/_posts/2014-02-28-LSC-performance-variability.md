# Abstract 

Porous La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3-δ</sub> (LSC)
 electrodes with Sr composition x = 0.2 (LSC-82) and x = 0.4 (LSC-64) were prepared by screenprinting LSC
 powders onto rare-earth doped ceria electrolytes, followed by sintering at 950 ∼ 1100◦C, and characterization using
 scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface-area analysis, 3-D morphological imaging based on
 focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX/EDS).
 The batch-tobatch variability and degradation (over 1000 ∼ 2000 hours) of the electrochemical performance of these cells
 were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and measurements of nonlinear electrochemical impedance
 (NLEIS). These measurements reveal a strong correlation between the characteristic frequency (ω<sub>c</sub>) and characteristic
 resistance (R<sub>c</sub>) of the electrodes, which, when analyzed in light of microstructural data, indicates that
 performance variability and degradation are caused primarily by variations in the surface rate coefficient k(T) for
 O<sub>2</sub> exchange.
