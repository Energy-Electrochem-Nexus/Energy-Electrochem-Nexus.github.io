# Abstract 

Identical strontium-doped LaMnO<sub>3</sub> and yttria-doped zirconia (LSM-YSZ) composite electrodes were characterized in
 three separate cell configurations, in air at 973 K using impedance spectroscopy. These configurations included a single-cell solid oxide fuel
 cell (SOFC), a symmetric cell (cathode/YSZ/cathode), and a thick pellet half-cell. Large discrepancies were observed in the measurements, with the
 electrode showing a current-independent area-specific resistance (ASR) of ~0.2 V cm<sub>2</sub> as an SOFC cathode, while nearly
 identical electrodes in the other two configurations exhibited nonlinear behavior, with ASR as large as 12 V cm<sub>2</sub>.
 The discrepancies are partly explained by electrode polarization effects. This has important implications for cathode characterization in SOFC.
