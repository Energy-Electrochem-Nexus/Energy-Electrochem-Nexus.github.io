# Abstract 

The electrochemical characteristics of porous Pt and La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>CoO<sub>3−δ</sub> (LSC)
 electrodes has been found to depend strongly on polishing of the underlying
 Ce<sub>0.8</sub>Sm<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2−δ</sub> (SDC)
 electrolyte using SiC and/or diamond prior to cell fabrication. The effect of
 surface treatment on the microstructure and composition of SDC was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and
 electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. After high-temperature sintering, the surface of SDC is Sm-enriched and has granular
 morphology; grinding or polishing removes this grained layer and leads to a decrease in Sm concentration. Refiring of the polished
 electrolyte at 1450–1650°C results in restoration of the grain structure and Sm composition on the surface. It was found using
 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that the surface treatment most strongly influences the high-frequency component of the
 impedance, suggesting the changes are associated primarily with an interfacial resistance.
