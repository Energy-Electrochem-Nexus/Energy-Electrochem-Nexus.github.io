# Abstract 

We report the design of a Faraday balance that can be used to measure the magnetization of
 transition metal oxides at high temperatures and under controlled atmosphere. The instrument is
 sufficiently sensitive and stable to quantify the magnetic force on diamagnetic and paramagnetic
 samples at temperatures up to 1000° C and in oxygen partial pressures as low as 100 ppm. We
 demonstrate the performance of the instrument by presenting preliminary magnetic measurements
 of lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide (La<sub>1−x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>3−δ</sub>)
 and aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
