# Abstract 

A framework is presented for defining charge-transfer and non-charge-transfer processes in solid state electrochemical systems. We examine why charge-transfer
 models have difficulty modeling non-charge-transfer effects, and walk through several examples including the ALS model for oxygen reduction on a porous
 mixed-conducting oxygen electrode. These examples illustrate that electrode ‘overpotential’ is often better described in terms of macroscopic thermodynamic gradients 
 of chemical species. In the case of a porous mixed conducting oxygen electrode, oxygen reduction is limited by chemical reaction and diffusion, and may occur up to
 20 microns from the electrochemical (charge-transfer) interface.
