# Abstract 

A universal challenge facing the development of electrochemical materials is our lack of understanding of physical
 and chemical processes at local length scales in the 10â€“100 nm regime, and acquiring this understanding requires a new generation
 of imaging techniques. In this article, we introduce the scanning thermo-ionic microscopy (STIM) for probing local electrochemistry at
 the nanoscale, using for imaging the Vegard strain induced via thermal stress excitations. Since ionic oscillation is driven by the stress
 instead of voltage, the responses are insensitive to the electromechanical, electrostatic, and capacitive effects, and they are immune to
 global current perturbation, making in-operando testing possible.
