Almost all of our current members have worked or are working on physics-based models, from the intricate reaction mechanism of oxygen vacancy in
 materials to system-level SOFC stack. We continue our modeling work and now with the integration of data science and machine learning tools to interpret
 measured responses in terms of physics, chemistry, and operational parameters.
