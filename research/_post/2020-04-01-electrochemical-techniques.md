Over the past years of research, we have pushed the envelope of what we can probe within the electrochemical system. Examples of
 techniques and tests we've used: scanning thermo-ionic microscopy, Faraday balance for magnetization measurement, electrochemical
 strain microscopy. These measurements have proved valuable in elucidating the materials characteristics, kinetics and transport processes
 of SOFC electrodes and electrolyte.
